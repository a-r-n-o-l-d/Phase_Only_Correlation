# Phase_Only_Correlation ImageJ plugin

## Description

This ImageJ plugin computes the [phase only correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation) between two
images. From phase only correlation, we can estimate the translation between two images and then perform basic image
registration.
